They sent a package of Brandon Ingram, Lonzo\Ball, Josh Hart, and 3 first-round picks to New Orleans to land Davis.  Those three have made good developments with the Pelicans, especially\Brandon Ingram.  But, the deal is still a huge win for the Lakers as Lebron, Davis, and company have put together an incredible season.  Los Angeles\has ridden James and Davis, along with a supporting cast built around them, to the second-best record in the NBA.  The Lakers ended the season\ atop the Western Conference with a record of 49-14.  They were narrowly behind the Bucks for the best record in the league.  Davis proved to be  the \ final piece necessary for the Lakers to rebound from missing the playoffs last year.  Los Angeles was a dominant club on both sides of the ball and\ are in a position to have another successful year next season.")
